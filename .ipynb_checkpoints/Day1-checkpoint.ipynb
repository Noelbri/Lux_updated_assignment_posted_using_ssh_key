    "The transformer model is a neural network used to perform machine learning tasks. The transformer Architecture is a model that uses self-attention to transform one whole sentence into a single sentence.\n",
    "The transformers revolutionized conversational AI by enabling models to process and generate language with unprecedented accuracy and coherence. The evolution from rule-based systems to transformers-based architecture like GPT represents a significant leap in enabling AI to simulate human-like conversation effectively"
